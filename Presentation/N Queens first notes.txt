Step by step idea:

1) Generate a square array of arrays occupied with 0s (indicating no queens present) of size n x n
2) Set the goal number of queens which is equal to n and set the current number of queens placed as 0
3) Start at the bottom left square (n,0) and check in all directions for a queen
4) If no queen if found place a queen, then recall that function recursively for the next square across
5) If the queen can't be placed there backtrack to the previous square and select the next.
6) If there is no more available spaces for the next queen then backtrack to the previous move and remove the queen
7) Continue until queen goal has been reached or the end of the board is met
